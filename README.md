# algorithm-problems

Algorithm problems: data sructures, sorting, search. \
This project uses TypeScript.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn test`

Runs the tests using `jest` and `ts-jest`.

### `yarn test-watch`

Runs the tests in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Compiles all TypeScript files with the settings from `tsconfig.json`. JS files can be found in the `build` folder. **This is not needed for testing**.

## List of Algorithms

### A) Arrays/N-dimensional arrays/Stacks/Queues

1. Maximum value of an array without using loops.
2. Display the numbers from 1 to 100 without using loops/conditionals.
3. Find the largest area formed by rectangles of 1's in a binary matrix.
4. Find groups of 1's in an MxN matrix.
5. Rotate a matrix of numbers by 90 deg.
6. Merge two sorted arrays where one has enough space at the end for the other.
7. Given an MxN matrix, if any element is zero, make that column and row all zeroes.
8. Given two arrays of single-digit numbers, create a function that will add them and produce the result in the same format as the inputs. Example: `a = [9, 9], b = [1]` so `o = [1, 0, 0]`.
9. Given an array with values ranging from `0` to `n-1`, swap each array location with the value on the nth position with `a[a[n]]`.
10. Shuffle an array.
11. Write a function that will reverse N sized blocks of an array.
